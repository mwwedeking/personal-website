                    This is going to be my very first website. I will use this as an opportunity
                    to become more familiar with front end development. I hope to utilize both
                    HTML and CSS, as well as JavaScript, in order to familarize myself with them. I 
                    would also like to use this as an opportunity to show case my projects as well 
                    as to display my personal and professional achievements.

                    After concluding my service with the United State Marine Corps 
                    in the summer of 2021, I decided to pursue a higher education. 
                    As a long-lived South Carolina native, I enrolled with the 
                    University of South Carolina. Always having had a fond interest 
                    in business as well as computers, I found that Comptuer Information 
                    Systems at USC was the right program for me. As of the summer 
                    of 2024, I am a current senior and I have recently began working 
                    in a Business & Technology Co-op position as a software developer. 
                    Currently, I am on track and scheduled to graudate in May of 2026.
