                        This is going to be my very first website. I will use this as an opportunity
                        to become more familiar with front end development. I hope to utilize both
                        HTML and CSS, as well as JavaScript, in order to familarize myself with them. I 
                        would also like to use this as an opportunity to show case my projects as well 
                        as to display my personal and professional achievements.</p>

                        After concluding my service with the United State Marine Corps 
                        in the summer of 2021, I decided to pursue a higher education. 
                        As a long-lived South Carolina native, I enrolled with the 
                        University of South Carolina. Always having had a fond interest 
                        in business as well as computers, I found that Comptuer Information 
                        Systems at USC was the right program for me. As of the summer 
                        of 2024, I am a current senior and I have recently began working 
                        in a Business & Technology Co-op position as a software developer. 
                        Currently, I am on track and scheduled to graudate in May of 2026.</p>
