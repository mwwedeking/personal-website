                        Hello, my name is Miles Wedeking. I am 25 years old and I'm
                        a current senior at the University of South Carolina,
                        studying Computer Information Systems. I was born and
                        raised on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. I have
                        developed a deep passion for learning about the world
                        as well as striving to become the best version of myself!
                        You have reached my personal website, which I have used
                        to practice front-end web development skills and show 
                        case some of my personal and professional achievements.</p>
                </span>

                <span class="about-content">
                    <p class="about-text text-1" style="text-indent: 50px">
                        My Mother and Father raised me in such a way as to 
                        always embrace my spontaneous and abstract thinking. 
                        Early on, I developed an interest in how things work. 
                        I began to question observations that I made about life, 
                        beyond the scope of what meets the eye. Being a teen 
                        who struggled to sit still, I managed to express myself 
                        through my passions in antique vehicle mechanics, computers, 
                        and athletics.</p>
                    <div class="about-profile-container"><img class="about-profile graduation" src="Images/HighschoolGraduationZoomed.jpg"></div>
                </span>

                <div class="about-content">
                    <div class="about-profile-container"><img class="about-profile" src="Images/BootcampHeadshot.jpg"></div>
                    <p class="about-text text-2" style="text-indent: 50px">
                        In my senior year of high school, I answered the call to 
                        defend my nation by enlisting in the United States Marine 
                        Corps in September, 2017. Having no idea the impact that 
                        this would have on my character development, I committed 
                        to making the most of every opportunity I had. It was during 
                        these four years that I truly discovered how important it is 
                        for me to forever strive to becoming the best version of myself 
                        possible.</p>
