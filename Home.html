                            Hello, my name is Miles Wedeking. I am 25 years old and I'm
                            a current senior at the University of South Carolina,
                            studying Computer Information Systems. I was born and
                            raised on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. I have
                            developed a deep passion for learning about the world
                            as well as striving to become the best version of myself!
                            You have reached my personal website, which I have used
                            to practice front-end web development skills and show 
                            case some of my personal and professional achievements.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="section-container-content-container-group">
                        <p class="section-container-content-container-group-text">
                            My Mother and Father raised me in such a way as to 
                            always embrace my spontaneous and abstract thinking. 
                            Early on, I developed an interest in how things work. 
                            I began to question observations that I made about life, 
                            beyond the scope of what meets the eye. Being a teen 
                            who struggled to sit still, I managed to express myself 
                            through my passions in antique vehicle mechanics, computers, 
                            and athletics.
                        </p>

                        <p class="section-container-content-container-group-text">
                            In my senior year of high school, I answered the call to 
                            defend my nation by enlisting in the United States Marine 
                            Corps in September, 2017. Having no idea the impact that 
                            this would have on my character development, I committed 
                            to making the most of every opportunity I had. It was during 
                            these four years that I truly discovered how important it is 
                            for me to forever strive to becoming the best version of myself 
                            possible.
